/**
 * Copies the state a form is bound to, so that the store and the local copy of
 * the component never share a reference.
 *
 * `structuredClone` keeps `Map`, `Set`, `RegExp` and typed arrays, which the
 * hand-written `deepCopy` turns into plain objects, and it copies a `Date`,
 * which `deepCopy` shares with the store by reference (#975). It is missing
 * in older runtimes and throws on a value it cannot serialize, a function or
 * a DOM node, so one such value anywhere in the state sends the whole copy
 * through `deepCopy`. The raw value is cloned: a reactive proxy has no
 * internal slots of the object it wraps, and `structuredClone` reads those.
